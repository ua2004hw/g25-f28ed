# **Task 2**

## Task scenarios

In a task scenario, you will get users of the prototype to perform a task on both prototypes. This usually
corresponds to a short paragraph describing a hypothetical use case
scenario that sets the scene before the users start interacting with your
prototype.

To achieve the highest score remember to

- list Adequate task scenarios
- provide a detailed description of each scenario

2-3 scenarios are expected

as we are prototyping a public transport app, here is an example task

1.  Route Planning:

    - Task: Plan a route from [specific starting location] to [specific destination].
    - Measure: Time taken to find the route, number of steps involved, and accuracy of the recommended route.

2.  Real-Time Updates:

    - Task: Check for real-time updates or delays on a specific route or line.
    - Measure: Time taken to find the information, accuracy of real-time data, and ease of understanding.

3.  Schedule Check:

    - Task: Check the schedule for the next available bus/train/tram from [specific location] to [specific destination].
    - Measure: Time taken to find the schedule and accuracy of the information.

## Sample Interaction

This task will be continued after we make a few screens in **Justinmind**
