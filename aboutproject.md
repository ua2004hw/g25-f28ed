# Public Transport App ðŸš… ðŸšŒ ðŸš•

---

## Intro

Currently, Dubai's public transport relies on more than four separate applications, each carrying out the same tasks with less than satisfactory precision. The envisioned solution involves consolidating these functionalities into a single unified app. This unified app will offer precise, real-time tracking capabilities and enhance the overall interface for all other features it provides, streamlining the user experience for a more efficient and reliable public transportation system.

Our Hypothesis

> By redesigning the user interface (UI) and enhancing the overall user experience (UX) of the public transport app, we expect to increase user engagement and satisfaction, resulting in a higher adoption rate and increased daily usage.
