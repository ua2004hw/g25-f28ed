# **Task 3**

## The Forms

### Consent Form

For this task, we need two forms:

First is the consent form, which will be given to every participant before starting the experiment.

**A few things to remember about the form**

- the consent form should not reveal info about one or both of the prototypes
- it should have a nice summary of the project without revealing the conditions
- describe what sort of data will be gathered

you can find the form here

### Ethics Form

Secondly, we need an Ethics Approval Form, which requires answering a few questions about the ethics of our experiment. This form will be reviewed by the faculty and could make or break our project.

The ethics form can be found here [Ethics From](https://canvas.hw.ac.uk/courses/25096/files/2979567?module_item_id=1802322)
